-1- DATA CONTENT

Book.csv contains 537 rows, each representing a distinct book. In each row, the first number is an integer, which is the total number of user ratings received for the book. The integer is then followed by a vector of 10 real numbers, which represents the distribution of the ratings over the discrete range of 1 to 10. Specifically, the i-th real number indicates the percentage of users who gave i point(s) to the book.
